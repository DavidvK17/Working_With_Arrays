# Working with Arrays and applying Array Methods

- slice (create a shallow copy)

* filter (create a new array)

- SPREAD Operator

In this challenge sequence, I presume that two girls, Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners
about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy.
A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years
old.
